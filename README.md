# PAGE BLOCK CLASSIFICATION

## Description
Our purpose is to train a Neural Network with a Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Page+Blocks+Classification) and using it to identify the right type of page layout. This is a Supervised Classification problem.

This project is focused about the Neural Network analysis and its behaviour when we change the parameters, with an explanation of the results.

## Requirements
MATLAB R2015a
Matlab Neural Networks Toolbox

## Installation
Be careful that [page-blocks.txt](page-blocks.txt) and [pageBlocks.m](pageBlocks.m) are in the same directory.

Set the Matlab current folder in the same directory of [page-blocks.txt](page-blocks.txt).
